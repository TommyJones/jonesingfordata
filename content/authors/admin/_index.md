My name is Tommy. I'm a member of the technical staff at [In-Q-Tel](https://www.iqt.org/) and a coordinator for [Data Science DC](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-DC/). I have an MS in mathematics and statistics from Georgetown University and a BA in economics from the College of William and Mary. I am also a PhD student in the George Mason University Department of Computational and Data Sciences. I am the author of the [textmineR](https://rtextminer.com) package for the R language. I am also a Marine Corps veteran. My opinions are terrible and they are all my own.
