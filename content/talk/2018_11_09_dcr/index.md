address: []

summary: An introduction to textmineR v3.x which introduced new features.
abstract: "This talk introduced textmineR to a new audience. This version of textmineR brought a Gibbs sampler I wrote with additional functionality for those training LDA models.

textmineR is an aid for text mining in R, with a syntax that is more familiar to experienced R users. Also, implements various functions related to topic modeling, making it a good topic modeling work bench.

textmineR was created with three principles in mind:

1. Maximize interoperability within Râ€™s ecosystem
2. Scaleable in terms of object storeage and computation time
3. Syntax that is idiomatic to R"
