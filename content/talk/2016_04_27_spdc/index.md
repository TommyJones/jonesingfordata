summary: The first time I spoke about textminR in public
abstract: "[textmineR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/textmineR/index.html) introduces a framework for natural language processing (NLP) in R that improves upon current NLP frameworks available in R. Specifically, textmineR has a syntax that is more intuitive to experienced R users. It uses objects, methods, and functions that behave like regular R dense matrices. This lowers the barrier to beginning statistical analyses of language to statisticians and other data professionals."
