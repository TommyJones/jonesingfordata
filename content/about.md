My name is Tommy. I'm a member of the technical staff at In-Q-Tel and a coordinator for Data Science DC. I have an MS in mathematics and statistics from Georgetown University and a BA in economics from the College of William and Mary. I am also a PhD student in the George Mason University Department of Computational and Data Sciences. I am the author of the textmineR package for the R language. I am also a Marine Corps veteran. Terrible opinions are my own.
